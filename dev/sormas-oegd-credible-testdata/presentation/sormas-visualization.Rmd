## Software

SORMAS is an infectious-disease surveillance and response tool for recording:

- **cases** (persons infected)
- their **contacts**
- **events** and their **participants**

\vspace{0.75cm}

open source

deployed in France, Germany, Ghana, Nigeria, Switzerland

HZI + partners: development, training, support

current development focus on **COVID-19**

## Data

High dimensional:

- person (address, phone number, sex, age, occupation, ...)
- disease course (symptoms, laboratory tests, ...)
- context (setting of event, ...)
- workflow of public-health workers (contact in quarantaine, ...)

... and much more!

N.B. strong data privacy

\vspace{0.75cm}

In progress: generation of a **credible synthetic data set** for

- software testing
- training
- **analyses, visualizations, collaborations**

## Visualizations

### The usual

\vspace{0.5cm}

- distributions
- time series
- choropleth maps
- ...

\vspace{1cm}

### Indicators

\vspace{0.5cm}

- reproduction number $R_e$
- dispersion factor $K$
- anomaly detection
- ...

### Networks

\vspace{0.5cm}

the most interesting... and challenging!

\vspace{0.5cm}

Idea/requirement: 

- graphs of **infections**, **contacts** and **event participation**
- both **abstract** and in geographical **space**
- highlight necessary collaboration between adminstartive units

\vspace{0.5cm}

Difficulty:

- quickly difficult to read, e.g. ~ 13,000 persons and events in COVID-19 test data for only 3 counties
- high-dimensionality of relevant information

\vspace{0.5cm}

$\Longrightarrow$ need to hierarchize and navigate information!

## Networks: first idea

\small

In progress, rough sketch... still messy!

\vspace{0.25cm}

1. Build graph:
- nodes = persons and events
- edges = infection, contact and participation

\vspace{0.25cm}

2. Filter nodes:
- by time, e.g. of reporting
- by **components** (connected subgraphs) ~ clusters

\normalsize

\tiny
N.B. COVID19 component sizes skewed: most cases infect no one, a few larger clusters
\normalsize

\vspace{0.25cm}

\small

3. Aggregation at regional level:
- highlight *trans-regional* components

\vspace{0.25cm}

4. Visualization:
- node color = type of person or event
- node size = degree or betweenness (aggregated: number of persons)
- edge type = type relation (aggregated: number of relations)
- **interactive**
