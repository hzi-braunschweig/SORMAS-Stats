# Symptoms:
# Probabilities of different symptoms given that the person has symptoms..
# Adapted from https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/19/ ...
# ... coronavirus-symptoms-how-to-tell-if-you-have-a-common-cold-flu-or-covid
# `term` is the term indicated in the article, `prob` the rough, somewhat
# arbitrary translation as a probability.
# `p_asymptomatic` is the probability of no symptom ("asymptomatic",
# 40% in best estimate scenario from CDC on 2020-9-10,
# https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#box1 )
# The assignment of symptoms takes RKI's case definition into account, where
# for simplicity "klinisch" means that at least one symptom was observed:
# - case definition A: unknown (there might be symptoms)
# - case definition B: there are symptoms
# - case definition C: there are symptoms
# - case definition D: there are *no* symptoms
# - case definition E: unknown (there might be symptoms)
# Contacts (persons that are not cases) have missing symptoms.
