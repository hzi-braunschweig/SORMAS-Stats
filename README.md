# Welcome
This project's goal is to provide first class statistics for SORMAS.

The high level idea for SORMAS-Stats is to have a dedicated container running in the SORMAS-Docker deployment (separations of concern). The container runs `R` and `python` scripts on a CRON schedule. The statistic scripts fetch data from the sormas DB with a read-only role and write their results back into a dedicated statistics database. This statistics database can easily be consumed by all sorts other tools for example Grafana or R-Shiny for visualization. The visualizations could be made accessible from SORMAS either by navigating to them through a button click or by using iframes.

# REMINDER
* This is alpha code
* DO NOT CONNECT THIS TO A PRODUCTION SERVER

# FAQ
* Does it work (yet): Reasonable well
* Should I use it in production: Absolutely not
* Will it eat my laundry: Yes


# Base directory structure

# How do I build and run it?
1. Start the stack via `docker-compose up -d`. This might take a while as this starts more or less a complete [SORMAS-Docker]() deployment including together with the `statistics` and `grafana` container of this repository. 
1. Insert this line into your /etc/hosts file: `127.0.0.1	sormas-docker-test.com`
1. Once the stack has started, navigate to `sormas-docker-test.com`. Use the devloper mode to generate sample data.
1. Navigate to `localhost:3000` and login with `admin:admin` to access Grafana. The `SORMAS Main` dashord`contains the visualizations. 


The statistics scripts which pull data from the SORMAS-DB and store the results in the statistic DB are currently executed every minute.

# How do I contribute?
First of all: Thank you for getting involved, we love contributions! Follow these steps:
1. Pick or create an issue which you want to resolve
1. Fork the project
1. From the repo base folder run `git checkout devlopment && git checkout -b feature/$issue-numer$-$some-name$`. This helps the team to keep overview.
1. Start your work: *PLEASE* include the issue number you are working on at the beginning of each commit message. E.g., for commits belonging to issue 123 use `git commit -m '[#123] your message here'` for each commit. GitHub will automatically use this to link issues and commits which makes at lot things easier.
1. Open a Pull Request. For bigger changes, you can also consider to open a draft PR such that we can take a first look at what is going on.
